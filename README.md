# MelonDS Desktop Cheats

This repository contains the .mch cheat files dumped from "DeadSkullzJr's NDS(i) Cheat Databases"'s <code>cheats.xml</code> file, usable onto the desktop versions of [MelonDS](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS).

To use a cheat file, go to **System -> Setup cheat codes** and enable the cheats you want. You also need to check **Enable Cheats** option into the same tab menu.

**Remember to rename the selected .mch file with the same name used for the NDS ROM, otherwise MelonDS will continue to use the built-in cheat database.**

I used [Phosphorous-M](https://github.com/Phosphorus-M)'s Cheat-Parser and a Python script (also included into this repo) to dump all the contents of <code>cheats.xml</code> file.
